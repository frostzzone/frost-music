## [0.1.2] - 2024-04-26

This is the first release, as this is  and mostly a test, it is not a major release (1.0.0)

Why is this not version 0.1.0
</summary>

---

As I (@frostzzone) am very stupid, I published this with no readme(v 0.1.0), then a non fixed readme (placeholder text `<packagename-here>`, and wrong code v 0.1.1), deleted the repo and package (because im stupid), tried to republish everything but (as i later found out) npm doesnt allow republished packages to use old deleted versions.
